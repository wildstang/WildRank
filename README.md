# LiamRank

Yet another FRC scouting app.

## Intro
LiamRank is a FIRST Robotics Competition scouting web app and a spiritual successor to the [WildRank Android](https://github.com/wildstang/wildrank-android) platform I helped develop while a part of FRC team 111 in high school. Despite being a web app, the goal of LiamRank is not to host a webpage on a remote server while scouting on clients, but rather to run generic lightweight servers on each of the clients themselves so that the majority of the app is platform agnostic.
